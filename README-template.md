## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learned how to use div tags to seperate sections on the window and many other html tags that I have used in this project.

I am proud that I could complete this project successfully with a basic knowledge of html and css.

### Continued development

I am planning to do my future project in more concise way and neatly more than this.
